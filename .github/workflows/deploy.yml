          # We need to transfer the docker-compose.yml and nginx.conf to the server
          # Note: usually we scp these, but for simplicity in this action we can re-create them or pull from git.
          # Better approach for strictly GitOps: The action checks out code ON the server or we use SCP.
          # Here we will use a trick to write the files from the repo artifact if we had them, 
          # but since we are building a docker image, the compose file isn't INSIDE the image.
          # Let's use a simpler method: The repo is cloned on the runner, we can SCP the compose file.
